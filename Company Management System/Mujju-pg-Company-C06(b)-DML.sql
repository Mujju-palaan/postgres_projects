Additional Instructions:
Ensure that your queries are designed to run in a MySQL environment.
Maintain the integrity of foreign key relationships when performing updates or deletes.
Use subqueries and JOINs where necessary, especially for inserting or updating data based on conditions from related tables.
Pay special attention to JSON column operations using MySQLâ€™s JSON functions like JSON_SET(), JSON_REMOVE(), etc.
Ensure your queries follow best practices for data integrity.
